;;; autopair-latex.el --- Automatically pair dollar signs and \[,\] for math
;; mode in latex. Without this, math mode does not close on its own and the
;; coloring and formatting of the document gets messed up.

;;; Use:
;;
;; By default, 'C-c \' is bound to '\[','\]'. To initiate math mode, type
;; either '$' or 'C-c \', and emacs will automatically insert both the opening
;; and closing of math mode. Whereever you want math mode to end, type '$' or
;; 'C-c \', and emacs will insert a '$' or '\]' if needed, blink back where
;; math mode began, and move to the point right after end of math mode for you
;; to continue your document in text mode.
